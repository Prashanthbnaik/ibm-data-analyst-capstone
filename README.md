# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Project Objective

This capstone project focuses on analyzing developer survey data to uncover trends in programming skills, work preferences, compensation, and job satisfaction. The goal is to identify high-demand technologies and understand how experience, education, and employment type impact developer career outcomes. The project simulates a real-world data analysis engagement for a global IT consulting firm aiming to guide strategic workforce planning.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- IBM Cognos Analytics
- Excel
- Data Cleaning and Wrangling Techniques
- Statistical Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Normalization and Outlier Detection (Z-Score, IQR)
- Sql

## Key Insights

- Python, SQL, and JavaScript are consistently among the most used and desired programming languages.
- Hybrid work has emerged as the dominant model, especially for full-time professionals.
- Compensation and job satisfaction increase with years of professional coding experience.
- Higher education levels are linked to more stable employment and higher pay brackets.
- Certain technologies are more in demand across specific regions, highlighting localized skill trends.
